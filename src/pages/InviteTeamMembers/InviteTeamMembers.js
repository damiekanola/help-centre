            As businesses increasingly embrace Veerge for their operational needs,
            managing user access and permissions emerges as a paramount concern
            for security and collaboration.

            Veerge indeed offers a blend of convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, yet it also brings potential security vulnerabilities if not wielded with care. Within the Veerge ecosystem, diverse users hailing from various departments and hierarchies demand access to a spectrum of applications and data. Skillful administration of these users and their access privileges is a linchpin against unauthorized entry, ensuring that personnel hold just the right level of access pertinent to their roles. This is where the Teams feature comes to the forefront, supported by a robust framework known as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

          <Text as='p' marginTop="20px" fontWeight={500} letterSpacing={'1.92px'}>
            RBAC orchestrates access rights and permissions based on users'
            designated roles within an organization.
          </Text>
          <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
            Each role is harmonized with explicit tasks, responsibilities, and gradations of access. Through RBAC implementation, administrators can adeptly dictate who can access specific data, thereby safeguarding that users exclusively interact with resources pertinent to their roles. This framework not only fortifies security but also
            simplifies user management while untangling the intricacies of permission
            assignments
