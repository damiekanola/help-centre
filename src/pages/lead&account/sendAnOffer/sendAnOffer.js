        Absolutely. Here's what you can do: Head to the 'Pending Offer' section, and
        you'll find the respective account number. Proceed to initiate a transfer to this
        account. As soon as the transaction is complete, the updates will seamlessly reflect on both ends, ensuring accurate records. If you require any further assistance with this process, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

            In the realm of real estate transactions, negotiation often plays a pivotal role.
            Within this landscape, the price displayed on the user’s application most times
            is not set in stone for the development company—it's subject to negotiation.
            This is where 'Private Offer' feature comes into play. Imagine a potential buyer
            spotting a property on your application and desiring to explore a deal more
            aligned with their preferences. In such cases, they can interact with the chatbot
            or get in touch via phone to initiate negotiations.
          </Text>
          <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
            Should the development company entertain the offered price, they will
            generate a 'Private Offer' tailored to the negotiated terms. This confidential
            proposition grants the prospective buyer access to a personalized deal beyond
            what's publicly listed on the application.
