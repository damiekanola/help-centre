            On Veerge, a theme refers to the overall design and layout of your application. It encompasses the appearance and functionality of your application, including the user interface, navigation, color scheme, typography, and more. Themes offer the flexibility to customize the look and feel of your Veerge application without the need for advanced app development or coding skills.

            When developing an application on Veerge, you have the option to choose from both free and paid themes. The paid theme is automatically generated based on your existing website layout. Veerge leverages embedded tools and frameworks to assist in generating UI prototypes and wireframes, but some level of human involvement and customization is usually required to ensure it meets your expectations.

            It's recommended to schedule a meeting with Veerge support to discuss your business needs, thoughtful design decisions, user experience considerations, and specific application requirements and goals. Automated generation may not accurately capture these nuances without human intervention.

            Once you've approved a theme, you can preview how it will appear in your application before integrating it with APIs. This allows you to experiment, make adjustments, and ensure it aligns with your vision.

            For updating and switching themes, you can modify your theme at any time to take advantage of new features, bug fixes, or updates released by Veerge. If you decide to switch to a different theme, you can contact Veerge support for assistance. However, it's important to note that changing themes may require reconfiguring certain settings and redoing specific customizations.
