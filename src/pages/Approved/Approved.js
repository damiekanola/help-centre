        `Hello Daniel,
        Your initiative, is a valid approach, and it can indeed be effective. However, it's essential to ensure that each team member has the necessary permissions to create listings. To confirm this, please navigate to the "Manage Roles" section, where you can verify their access levels and adjust them accordingly. This way, you'll be able to maintain a smooth workflow and make the most of your 20
        development projects, both past and present.`

        `Hello, 
        It's crucial to adhere to the following sequence of steps. If you migrate your client base before adding development projects, you won't be able to associate the properties that your clients purchased prior to the migration with Veerge. 
        Consequently, when your clients sign up, their property portfolios will appear empty. To rectify this issue, I recommend scheduling an appointment with our support team for assistance in resolving this matter.`
