            Hello,
            There could be multiple factors contributing to your lack of receiving an OTP (One-Time Password):
          </Text>

          <OrderedList>
            <ListItem mt='20px'>
              <b>Correct Information:</b> Ensure that you have accurately entered your phone number during the registration process. Double-check for any potential typos or errors.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem mt='20px'>
              <b>Network Issues:</b> Delays in receiving OTPs may arise due to network related problems. Verify your network connectivity and attempt the process again.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem mt='20px'>
              <b>Server Delays:</b> The service responsible for providing the OTP might be encountering technical complications or delays. These delays might be the result of server disruptions or high levels of user traffic.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem mt='20px'>
              <b>Device Issues:</b> If you are using a device that experiences difficulties in receiving messages—such as an older phone or a device with limited storage—it could impede the delivery of OTPs.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem mt='20px'>
              <b>Mobile Carrier Issues:</b> In instances where you are not receiving OTPs via SMS, it is plausible that your mobile carrier is facing problems with message delivery.
            </ListItem>
          </OrderedList>
          <Text mt='20px'>
            As an alternative, consider exploring the option of utilizing voice OTPs, which can offer an alternative approach to authentication.

        We understand that you may have questions about the recent rejection of your application. The reasons for rejection could stem from a few factors. These might include challenges in verifying the status of your property development company, the possibility that the individual who created the account lacked the authority to enter agreements on behalf of the company, or discrepancies in the
        information provided.
        If you have received a rejection email, the specific reason for the rejection should have been detailed within that communication. We encourage you to review the email for further clarification on the decision. If you require any assistance or have additional inquiries, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. We're here to help address any concerns you may have.
