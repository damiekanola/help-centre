              Meeting and exceeding expectations is not a random occurrence but a deliberate outcome that requires careful design.
              It is crucial to understand how your buyers perceive and interact with your business, as it plays a pivotal role in your marketing efforts.
              Achieving seamless interaction with your business necessitates the use of an engagement interface.
              This interface is the foundational building block to staying relevant in todayâ€™s fast paced world.

              In the modern era of cloud computing and on-demand data, manual entry spreadsheets are becoming obsolete. However, real estate businesses are still traditionally operating under a reactive model involving manual processes and paper-based records. This results in slow and cumbersome processes. Fortunately, Veerge offers a proactive, digital, and automated solution that records every transaction on the system of engagement and logs it on the trust system, while saving time and resources.
            </Text>
            <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
              Let's consider how the traditional process of making a payment for a property works: Initially, a customer makes a payment, typically through a chosen payment method such as wire transfer, check, or online payment. Once the payment is made, the customer sends a payment document, such as an invoice or receipt, to the recipient or relevant parties involved. Upon receiving the payment document, it is manually processed by the recipient. The document is saved and organized within a designated folder or physical filing system for future reference. The next step involves manually entering the details from the payment document into the accounting system. The manual data entry process requires an employee to carefully input the relevant information, such as the payment amount, date, payer's details, and purpose of payment, into the accounting system. After the data entry is complete, a bookkeeping entry is reconciled or created, ensuring accurate financial records. However, this traditional process is not without its challenges. It is prone to human error, as manual data entry leaves room for mistakes or typos. Moreover, the process is time-consuming and can result in delays, especially during high-volume transaction.
            </Text>
            <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
              Veerge's Intelligence-powered data entry system transforms the payment process for real estate transactions. It eliminates the need for manual data entry by automatically creating bookkeeping entries once buyers make payments. Leveraging intelligent algorithms, Veerge streamlines the payment process, reduces the potential for duplicity, and ensures accuracy.
            </Text>
            <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
              One of the key advantages of Veerge is its system of trust, which doesn't require a third party to validate transactions. Instead, the system acts as a ledger of facts, making transaction information more readily available, easily documented, and managed. Transactions are processed 24/7, without any business hour or holiday cut-off times. Furthermore, transactions can be confirmed within minutes, providing real-time information on who paid, what the payment was for, when the payment was made, and the remaining balance.
            </Text>
            <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
              Veerge's digital and automated approach to tracking inventory is highly beneficial in reducing imbalances and inefficiencies. By ensuring that all parties involved have access to the most up-to-date information, Veerge facilitates transparency and enables better asset tracking, management, and risk reduction. This comprehensive view of assets also assists in budgeting and planning more effectively.

            <Text as='p' marginTop="20px">
              The smart contract feature within Veerge is particularly noteworthy. Smart contracts are autonomous computer program codes that facilitate, execute, and enforce the negotiation and performance of contracts or agreements based on predefined conditions. They can be used as a substitute or complement to traditional legal contracts. For example, a smart contract in Veerge could automatically grant permissions to a customer upon completing their payment plan or reaching specific milestones. It can also trigger contract termination and immediate listing of the property on the marketplace in the event of defaults.

              By leveraging intelligent data entry, comprehensive inventory tracking, and smart contracts, Veerge establishes a system of trust that enhances efficiency, accuracy, transparency, and security within the real estate industry. It streamlines processes, reduces manual work, and provides a more accessible and reliable platform for real estate transactions.
