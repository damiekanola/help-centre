In the case of co-ownership, the expiration date is determined by the host of the co-ownership who sets it. Additionally, when you send a private offer, the expiration date is based on what you specify. However, as a default, offers typically expire after 24 hours. If you have any specific scenarios or questions, please don't hesitate to ask."

            To modify the unit price, edit the price field accordingly. Be mindful that if a price adjustment is made, it could potentially impact users with pending transactions related to that specific price. You'll need to decide whether to continue with the new price or honor the old price for ongoing transactions until their expiration date. If your project involves payment plans, remember that updating prices here will only affect outright purchases. If changes to payment plan prices are required, a separate process is needed to ensure that modifications are reflected accurately.
