        "Hello Dhaval,This situation may have arisen due to the unit being archived before initiating the allocation step. To address this, follow these steps:Check the boxes of the specific units you intend to archive.Complete the archiving process.It's important to note that during the initial archiving, you didn't get to choose the exact units you wanted to archive. For instance, if there are 10 units under a category and you archived 5, you didn't specify whether it should be units Flat 1 to Flat 5 or Flat 5 to Flat 10. The screen prompt you encountered is designed to help you precisely select the units you wish to remove from archive.Should you require further assistance, don't hesitate to schedule a meeting with our support team. We're here to help!"

            Allocations play a vital role in ensuring precise unit assignment to the appropriate individuals, guided by factors like agreements, contracts, preferences, or prior purchases. This procedure holds particular significance in projects involving multiple units, such as apartment complexes or housing estates, where each unit boasts unique features, sizes, and values.
