        "Hi Sam, we've got that covered as well. On the application, what's displayed is a 'Call to Inquire' instead of the price. Once negotiations are completed, the development company can send a private offer directly from their portal to the interested buyer. This private offer feature also proves invaluable when someone wishes to negotiate the listed price on the application"

      replies: [
        "Hi Jerry, there's really no downside. If fractional ownership doesn't achieve the level of success that was anticipated, the development company can simply list the property on the application as usual. In that case, those who purchased fractional units will be reimbursed once the property is sold, and the development company will receive the remaining funds."

                Why do we emphasize personalization? Because buyers are not uniform entities with identical needs and preferences. Each buyer is a distinctive individual with specific desires, challenges, and dreams. By infusing a personal touch, we forge deep connections with buyers, nurturing loyalty and trust. Consistently delivering exceptional service that surpasses buyer expectations creates enduring, memorable experiences.

                Before we dive into the breakdown of how things work, it's important to note that there are two types of applications: basic and custom. The one in focus here is the custom application, which has already been fully deployed. Therefore, the steps we will discuss start from the point after deployment, leading to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

                After your application has been successfully deployed, your subscribers and potential buyers simply need to visit the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. There, they can search for your property development company's name, download the app, and proceed to sign up by providing some fundamental information, including their full name, email, phone number, and password. Once these details have been filled out, their account will be created, and they will be prompted to provide additional information.

                After completing the sign-up process, users gain effortless access to all available properties, including those that have already been sold, along with comprehensive information such as pricing, location, and property type. The information provided is continuously updated in real-time, eliminating the need for manual updates. It's like magic! Our system is intuitively designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that all information required for informed decision-making is readily available. Users can easily access pricing details, explore various payment plans and structures, and even identify nearby schools and recreational centers for a comprehensive understanding of the property's location.
                Furthermore, users have the option to schedule property inspections, whether in-person or through a convenient video chat.

It's this innovative feedback system that distinguishes Veerge from the conventional inspection processes used by most property development companies.

The current property price, along with available payment options, is readily accessible within the app. Prior to making the purchase, the buyer can review the purchase agreement at their convenience. Payment can be facilitated through the application's wallet or via bank payments. Our payment system is globally inclusive, supporting transactions in over 70 countries and more than 150 currencies.

                As your business continues to grow, managing revenue can become a complex and error-prone task. To effectively address this challenge, we have implemented a robust revenue recognition system. With this system in place, you can effortlessly track who has made payments and what those payments were made for. It serves as the definitive source of truth, enabling your accounting team to rely on accurate upstream data. Unlike conventional methods, there's no need for manual confirmation calls before paperwork can be signed. Once payment is confirmed, our integrated inventory management system is instantly updated. Moreover, when a particular property unit type is completely sold, the system notifies all relevant parties and restricts further purchases within the application."

                The core objective behind our creation is to deliver an unparalleled experience to our customers.

Have you ever encountered the exciting feature on certain travel booking websites that allows you to select your seat on a plane using a seat map? Well, we've incorporated a similar concept into Veerge, and we've made it exceptionally user-friendly.

                All a property development company needs to do is provide some essential information regarding unit numbering. They also have the flexibility to designate which units they don't want to be available for selection, such as those that are reserved. Furthermore, they can specify the milestone at which buyers or subscribers become eligible for unit allocation. Some companies opt for allocation after the initial deposit, while others prefer it after full payment, or even at the 50% payment mark. Some companies may also choose to handle allocations themselves. The beauty of Veerge is that it accommodates all these use cases seamlessly.

              <Text as='p' fontWeight={300} mt='30px'>
                The mobile application also boasts a secret weapon - co-ownership. Take someone like Ahmed Ali, for instance; he can invite his friends or family to join him in purchasing a property seamlessly. With co-ownership, they can split the costs based on their agreed-upon sharing ratio, all while ensuring that each party remains accountable for their financial commitments. It's truly a win-win situation for everyone involved!
                We liken this feature to the invention of the fax machine. When the first person acquired a fax machine, they couldn't make full use of it alone. Similar to the fax machine's inherent marketing potential, co-ownership itself is a marketing tool. By inviting friends and family to co-own, you not only fulfill your property goals but also extend the reach of the development company. Once the company delivers on its promises, these co-owners become long-term, loyal customers.

              <Text as='p' fontWeight={300} mt='30px'>
                One of the remarkable benefits offered by Veerge is the ability to fractionalize real estate without the need for intermediaries. Fractional ownership is a feature designed to provide individuals with limited purchasing power access to the real estate market, breaking down the traditional barriers to entry. This innovative approach doesn't change the fundamental way properties are sold; instead, it introduces a fresh perspective by dividing ownership into smaller, more affordable shares.
              </Text>
              <Text as='p' fontWeight={300} mt='30px'>
                For instance, consider a property with a total value of 50 million units. With fractional ownership, this property can be divided into 1,000 shares, each priced at 50,000 Naira, representing a fraction of the property's overall value. This means that individuals with varying budgets and investment capabilities can purchase a fraction of the property according to their financial capacity, even if it's a very small amount.
                This approach opens up exciting opportunities for a wider range of people to participate in the real estate market, enabling them to benefit from the property's value appreciation over time.

                AGENT

                An integral figure in numerous real estate transactions is the agent. In fact, for many real estate deals, agents play a pivotal role, akin to the vital function of kidneys in the human body. They often serve as intermediaries, and recognizing the significance of their contributions, we have equipped them with their own dedicated portal.
                This portal functions as a centralized hub and also reimagines the commission payout process for the sales team. Within this portal, agents gain access to critical information, including pricing details, marketing resources, performance metrics, and all the essential tools required for effective selling. Furthermore, it provides management teams with enhanced visibility into the entire sales process and performance metrics.
                The process for agents is streamlined and user-friendly. They simply visit your application to initiate the sign-up process. Upon submission of their application, you have the opportunity to review and, if it meets your criteria, grant approval. This approval grants them access to their dedicated portal. Any referrals generated by the agent are automatically logged, providing a record of their client acquisitions. Additionally, agents can monitor their customers' payment statuses, facilitating the identification of defaults and guiding follow-up actions when necessary.
