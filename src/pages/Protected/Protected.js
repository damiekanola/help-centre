          <Text as='p' fontWeight={400}>
            Mitigating downtime is crucial to ensure the availability and reliability of services. To address potential downtime, Veerge has implemented several measures while leveraging Myxellia microservices built on AWS (Amazon Web Services), a highly reliable cloud computing platform. These mitigants include:
