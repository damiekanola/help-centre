              WHY VEERGE?
            </Text>

            <Text>
              Veerge is undoubtedly the optimal choice for any property development company at this time, as it stands unrivaled by any alternative solution. Existing alternatives are not specifically tailored for real estate businesses, and when compared, Veerge consistently outshines them. The only viable alternative would be to assemble a team and build a solution from scratch or outsource the project to an IT company. However, this approach would involve numerous iterations and tackling challenging questions.
            </Text>

                    <b>Be radically honest, direct, and respectful:</b> Feedback should be necessary, clear, direct, and professional. Always say what needs to be said. Build on the feedback you receive. Step up, speak up, encourage others to do the same. Be respectful at all times. Find the best tone of voice, time, and situation to provide feedback.

                    <b>Start with "WHY?":</b> Think before executing - articulate your problem, probe into it. Is it a real problem? Challenge others to do the same. Seek data to support decision-making. If data is not available, be transparent that you're making an instinctual recommendation. Dive deep into the root cause. Solve from the first principles. Question experience, data, and assumptions. Always ask, "Is that true?" and "Why?". Constantly challenge your analysis, sense-check, look from every angle, and be prepared to revisit the proposed solution or initial problem.

                    <b>Never lose 'North':</b> Always think beyond the task at hand, keeping the bigger picture in mind. Think several steps ahead. (e.g., Will our solution create more problems? What will the next problem be once we solve this one?). Look for ways to create scalable frameworks and tools to increase the impact. Avoid 'analysis paralysis' so that we move toward solutions. Focus on the outcome and continue checking your compass along the way (i.e., Are we still going in the right direction?). If not, take courage to start from scratch.

                    <b>Be open-minded - listen, probe, adjust:</b> Invite criticism and alternative views to tackle problems better. Constantly challenge assumptions in your thinking. Do not follow any previously agreed-upon approach blindly. Take turns speaking and listening. Consider all feedback regardless of the person's title. There is no place for politics in Myxellia. Think through your recommendation, don't say "yes" or "no" too quickly.
