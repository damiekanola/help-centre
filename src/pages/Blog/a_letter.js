              As I expressed in the letter when I assumed the position of CEO, "This is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." In line with that, we also emphasized the need to constantly strive for more and pursue important and meaningful endeavors with the resources at our disposal. We have always believed that over time, companies tend to become complacent, merely making incremental changes.

              Today, I am filled with various emotions—pride, nostalgia, and a heavy heart. But above all, I am overwhelmed with a deep sense of gratitude. For years, I have harbored a dream of establishing a unique company, one with the potential to improve lives. Therefore, we are embarking on a new venture called Myxellia, and I am truly thrilled to lead it as CEO.

              It feels like just yesterday when I first walked through the doors of this company as the product lead, marking the beginning of a remarkable journey. Not only for me but for many of us.

              Who could have imagined the countless incredible products we have collectively built for other companies? Yet, these achievements do not define our true success. Now, we are embarking on a journey to revolutionize how millions of people access investment in real estate and finance, thereby positively transforming lives and communities across the world.

              When I reflect on what we stand for, I am reminded of how our mission, values, and guiding principles are about to manifest in reality. Many of you know that my intention was to establish a company that differentiates itself by striking a balance between profitability and social consciousness, compassion and rigor, and love and responsibility. We can only achieve this through your creativity, hard work, and the love you pour into the company, making it widely embraced and respected.

              As we prepare for this rebirth, I humbly urge everyone not to lose sight of what truly matters: our fellow partners and our customers. In every weekly leadership meeting and daily engineering meetings, I have always imagined two empty chairs in the room—one for a partner and one for a customer.
            </Text>
            <Text mt='30px'>
              When faced with a decision, I ask myself if the choice would make both of them proud. As a new company, I implore all of you to continue this tradition and let that answer guide us. I promise that these two chairs will serve us and the company well.

              Please remember that Myxellia will thrive when our products are inclusive and accessible to everyone. Let us remain true to our purpose while also fostering innovation around it. We must never embrace the status quo. Instead, let us possess the curiosity to explore uncharted territories and the courage to push for reinvention. Change is inevitable, and the world has become more fragile since we first embarked on this journey.
            </Text>
            <Text mt='30px'>
              Amidst the chaos, let us strive to listen with empathy, respond with kindness, and perform through the lens of humanity. We must not be mere bystanders; rather, we must take responsibility for what we witness and hear. No person or company is perfect, so we will learn from mistakes and practice forgiveness for ourselves and others. And when we achieve our goals, let us not forget that success is most meaningful when shared.
            </Text>
            <Text mt='30px'>
              However, success is never a given; it must be earned every day through hard work and teamwork. If we strive to be the best version of ourselves and bring out the best in others, our dreams will manifest repeatedly, and our mission, values, and guiding principles will endure.These values are of utmost importance to everything we do. I will continue to lead as a true servant leader as this esteemed company embarks on its next chapter.
