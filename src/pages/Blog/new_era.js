              A few years ago, we took a daring leap of faith, embarking on an extraordinary journey
              to establish our very own IT business solution company. Little did we know that this
              decision would lead us on a thrilling roller coaster ride, brimming with exhilarating
              challenges and triumphant moments. But you know what? We wouldn’t trade this adventure
              for anything else in the world.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              As we ventured forth, we encountered a pivotal business challenge that called upon the
              inner innovators within us. A property development company urging us to provide
              technology solutions that would elevate their bottom line. Elevating the bottom line
              rests on two fundamental pillars: The first is identifying business inefficiencies and
              streamlining operations, and the other is driving revenue. When it comes to revenue
              generation, one key aspect takes center stage — sales. However, sales are not merely
              an outcome; they are influenced by controllable input measures that, when injected
              into a business, yield the desired output of increased sales. In this regard, we
              strongly believe that personalization and consistently surpassing customer
              expectations reign supreme. When it comes to surpassing customers’ expectations, many
              Property development companies mistakenly associate it with building something unique
              and distinct. However, true differentiation resides in personalized experiences and
              the unwavering commitment to consistently exceed customer expectations. This form of
              differentiation pertains to the very essence of the business itself, extending beyond
              the confines of the product.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Business differentiation holds the key to nurturing loyalty, satisfaction, and
              generating positive word-of-mouth referrals. We refer to it as the “point of
              difference” because it transforms the customers into ambassadors of the brand,
              effectively making them the invaluable marketing department.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              So, the creation of extraordinary customer experiences, one customer at a time, is
              undeniably crucial for establishing a successful and enduring property development
              franchise in today’s competitive market. The question then arises: How do we achieve
              this paramount objective?

              <ListItem>
                How can we effectively personalize the business to make each potential buyer feel
                like the business was tailor-made for them? How do we empathize with buyers and
                understand their desires by putting ourselves in their shoes?
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                What strategies can we implement to enhance the longevity of your relationships with
                existing clients? This is crucial considering that approximately 65% of revenue for
                most large businesses stems from existing clients and word-of-mouth referrals from
                these clients.

                How can we strike a balance between day-to-day operations and planning of business
                strategies? When customers visit your site or contact the property development
                company to make enquiries, their preferences often differ from the current
                offerings. How do we determine the appropriate time to take action and effectively
                reach out to these customer segments when we finally have offerings that match their
                preferences?
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                How do we offer a buyer what he needs, when he needs it, how he needs it and now
                that the needs are ever evolving how do you evolve with these needs?
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                How do you we know when it’s time to take advantage of new revenue streams, explore
                unique opportunities that maximize an addressable market, and expand the customer
                base?
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                How can we build a strong relationship with each individual buyer such that the
                buyer’s behaviour informs what we sell to them and how you sell it to them?
              </ListItem>

            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Veerge offers a comprehensive CRM that delivers an exceptional customer 360
              experience, along with an advanced Inventory Management system, Transaction Management
              system, Task Management system, and more, seamlessly integrated with each other.
              However, what truly sets Veerge apart is its innovative web application development
              suite. With this suite, property development companies can effortlessly create fully
              functional web application interfaces without writing a single line of code. It’s as
              simple as a few clicks. But it’s not just any web application interface; it serves as
              a point of convergence, an all-encompassing marketplace where offerings and buyers
              coexist seamlessly every day. This coexistence is personalized to meet the unique
              needs of each buyer, creating a gold-standard experience that caters to every aspect
              of the home ownership journey.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              The emphasis on personalization is driven by the understanding that buyers are not
              homogenous entities with identical needs and preferences. Each buyer is unique, with
              specific desires, pain points, and aspirations. By providing a personal touch, Veerge
              establishes a deep connection with buyers, fostering loyalty and trust.

              Consistently delivering exceptional service that surpasses buyer expectations creates
              a memorable experience that leaves a lasting impression. Real estate has long been
              known as an industry resistant to change. However, if we wonder how transformative
              user experience is to an industry, we can reflect on the impact user interfaces had on
              banking. The advent of the internet and user-friendly interfaces revolutionized how we
              manage our finances. Online banking has become an integral part of our lives, and it’s
              challenging to imagine a time without it. While the core principles of banking have
              remained largely unchanged for centuries, the way we interact with our money has
              undergone a profound shift. The rise of mobile banking has made accessing funds as
              simple as a touch, swipe, or tap on a device. Visiting a branch, waiting for monthly
              statements, or relying on passbooks are things of the past. Balances are instantly
              available, new accounts can be opened with ease, and customers can seek help or
              connect with experts with just a tap.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Given this transformation in the banking industry, isn’t it time for property
              development companies to embrace this new era? Veerge, with its web application
              development suite, introduces a comprehensive platform that caters to every need of
              property development company buyers. Buyers can schedule inspections, view real-time
              property availability, make initial deposit payments (collected in over 74 countries
              and 154 currencies), track payments and outstanding balances, and even customize
              payments for their outstanding balance. Furthermore, all their purchase documents and
              associated files are conveniently stored in one place.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              These enhanced user interfaces and experiences play a pivotal role in customer
              satisfaction. By proactively delighting customers, a property development company can
              establish a distinguished reputation. Satisfied buyers are more likely to remain
              loyal, increase their spending, and contribute to long-term growth. Veerge empowers
              development companies to personalize the buyer’s journey and create a seamless and
              satisfying experience.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Veerge offers some other remarkable features that truly set it apart, co-ownership and
              fractional ownership are some of them. These features are game-changers in the real
              estate industry. With co-ownership, users have the ability to invite friends and
              family to purchase properties together, enabling those with lower purchasing power to
              participate. It addresses a common scenario where past clients of development
              companies still want to invest in properties being developed, but their budget may not
              align with the property’s price due to reduced buying capacity over time.
              Co-ownership’s brilliance can be likened to the impact of the fax machine. The
              marketing of the fax machine lives in the fax machine itself. Just like the first
              person who acquired a fax machine and activated its marketing potential by spreading
              the word, co-ownership ignites a similar mechanism of expanding opportunities and
              fostering collaboration among buyers.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              On the other hand, fractional ownership presents a slightly different approach.
              Development companies can choose to fractionalize certain properties instead of
              selling them as a whole. This enables individuals who may not know each other to
              purchase small portions of a property together. This innovative approach breaks down
              the barrier of high ticket prices and opens doors for more people to invest on their
              web application and benefit from real estate value appreciation.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Fractional ownership doesn’t alter the traditional property selling process; it
              divides ownership into smaller, more affordable portions. For instance, a property
              valued at 50 million can be divided into 1,000 shares, with each share representing a
              fraction of the property’s value. Individuals can then purchase fractions according to
              their budget and investment capability. Additionally, there is a voting poll for major
              decisions, ensuring participation and transparency among co-owners.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              These features not only benefit users by providing greater accessibility and
              investment options, but they also significantly enhance the cash flow velocity into
              development companies, maximizing growth potential. By effectively leveraging
              fractional real estate, businesses can ensure they capitalize on every opportunity,
              while their competitors struggle to serve customers who could potentially be theirs.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Consider this: 90% of fractional buyers are likely first-time real estate investors.
              If a business fulfills its promises and delivers on value creation, these satisfied
              customers become ambassadors, spreading positive experiences through word-of-mouth.
              This creates exponential growth potential for the company, as the purchasing power of
              fractional buyers is likely to increase over time. These are just some of the ways
              Veerge’s infrastructure personalizes the buyer’s experience, regardless of where they
              are on their real estate journey, by offering innovative solutions that cater to
              diverse needs and foster long-term relationships.

              As mentioned earlier, improving the bottom line involves two fundamental aspects:
              revenue generation and the identification of inefficiencies to streamline operations.
              We have already established how personalization can boost revenue. Now, let’s address
              the issue of fixing business inefficiencies. Inefficiencies within business processes
              can lead to significant financial losses. During our tenure as an IT business solution
              company, we encountered numerous cases where businesses achieved better returns on
              investment when they were smaller compared to when they expanded into larger entities.
              This prompted the important question: “How do you become big but stay small?”

              The solution lies in implementing an infrastructure that streamlines and optimizes
              workflows by automating repetitive tasks, eliminating errors, and reducing time
              requirements. By doing so, any company can enhance productivity, save time, and cut
              costs. As a business expands, managing revenue can become challenging and prone to
              mistakes. This is where Veerge’s revenue recognition solution becomes invaluable. It
              effortlessly provides a comprehensive understanding of all the business’s revenue,
              regardless of the source or earning method. Not only does it offer insights into who
              made payments and for which specific property, but it also provides visibility into
              the remaining balance. Moreover, the solution enables continuous tracking and
              projection of cash flow, ensuring that businesses stay informed about their financial
              position at all times. With this integrated solution, accurate revenue management is
              ensured, empowering businesses to make well-informed financial decisions.
