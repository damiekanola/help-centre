              Real estate, the golden ticket to wealth building, continues to entice investors
              seeking stability amidst the unpredictable stock market. But here’s the catch: for
              many young adults, the dream of owning property seems to drift further away as
              property prices soar higher than their incomes. Enter the hero of the hour:{' '}
              <b>Fractional ownership in real estate.</b>
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Now, you might be wondering, <b>“What on earth is fractional ownership?”</b> Well,
              it’s actually quite simple once you break it down. The word <b>“fractional”</b>{' '}
              implies dividing an asset into equal parts or fractions to make the costs more
              manageable. And <b>“ownership”</b> refers to the glorious sense of possessing a slice
              of the pie, or in this case, property.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Imagine this: a luxurious property worth a jaw-dropping 1 million dollars. Now, let’s
              slice it up into bite-sized portions of 100,000 shares, making each share a mere $10.
              Suddenly, individuals with limited financial firepower can hop on board and snatch up
              a fraction of the property that fits within their budget and investment capacity. It’s
              like a gateway opening up to a world of opportunities, where more people can ride the
              wave of value appreciation and revel in the cash flow generated over time.

            <Text mt="30px">
              Now, let’s clear up a couple of misconceptions that might be floating around. First,
              let’s not mistake fractional ownership for REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
              Sure, REITs offer a way to dip your toes into the real estate pool, but they might not
              fully satisfy your specific objectives. Why? Well, for starters, the options for
              traded-REITs that provide exposure to residential real estate are as scarce as finding
              a unicorn. The prices of REITs are also highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations
              and overall market sentiment. So you have to say goodbye to one of the most appealing
              aspects of real estate investing: the low correlation and diversification it brings to
              your portfolio. To also distinguish fractional ownership from those timeshare
              shenanigans: When you buy a timeshare, you’re essentially buying the right to use a
              property for a limited time each year. But the catch is you don’t actually own a piece
              of the property itself, You don’t get to savor the sweet taste of appreciation or bask
              in the glory of rental income when the property sits idle during your unused time.
              Someone else holds the keys to ownership and all you have is a mere usage right. So,
              fractional real estate ownership is like having your cake and eating it too! because
              you not only get a slice of the property but also enjoy your fair share of the income
              and profits it generates.

                Here comes the million-dollar question:{' '}
                <b>
                  “If fractional ownership is such a game-changer, why are so many startups still

                Lets explore the game’s rules that these startups must navigate. First, you need a
                breakthrough technology that solves a big problem. Check!. Then, the timing has to
                be just right for that problem to be solved. Check!. You also need a way to not only
                solve the problem but ensure it reaches the hands of those who are in desperate need
                of a solution. And here’s where many fractional startups stumble and fall flat on
                their faces.

                Their grand plan? To reach the masses through Instagram ads, YouTube ads, Facebook
                ads, influencers and other channels. But hold on a second. In a world where trust
                has been fractured and authenticity is more precious than gold, how do you
                distribute your solution using these channels? Trust, is the currency of investment.
                And in a time when people hunger for authenticity, how can startups build that trust
                without a solid track record? After all, people don’t dabble in real estate because
                they want to play risky games; it has traditionally been a safe harbor for their
                hard-earned money. However, it still doesn’t end there. Limited inventory is another
                hurdle that startups encounter due to their restricted resources. Let’s take a
                closer look at how startups acquire inventory. In certain regions, like Africa,
                payment plans are prevalent instead of traditional mortgage systems. Some startups
                strike payment plans with property development companies, reserving residential
                units to sell fractions of them on their platforms. However, this approach proves to
                be inefficient over time. Limited financial resources result in limited inventory
                that may not meet the diverse requirements of potential investors. Additionally,
                their limited marketing capabilities hinder their ability to attract fractional
                investors at a rapid pace, leading to payment defaults and foreclosures. Foreclosure
                on payment plan properties in Africa often comes with hefty penalties, sometimes as
                high as 30%. Startups find themselves in a bind, needing to refund the money and
                bear the burden of the fees. It’s worth noting that not all fractional startups face
                this issue. Some have established strong relationships with property development
                companies and enjoy more convenient agreements. However, these challenges still
                persist. Managing and operating a fractional ownership model can also incur
                substantial administrative costs. From ensuring proper legal documentation to
                coordinating multiple investors and maintaining the overall structure, it’s a
                resource-intensive endeavor that can strain the startup’s limited resources.

                Furthermore, fractional ownership, though not entirely new, still lacks widespread
                acceptance and understanding. Lack of awareness and education surrounding fractional
                ownership has led to slower adoption and limited market demand. It’s like a hidden
                gem waiting to be discovered by the masses. And let’s not forget about those pesky
                regulatory complexities. Navigating the regulatory landscape can be a formidable
                challenge for startups, and many are still grappling with finding a way around it.

              <Text>
                Here comes the ultimate hurdle — limited liquidity. Unlike traditional investments
                like stocks or bonds, real estate is an illiquid asset. Selling or exiting the
                investment quickly can prove to be quite the challenge. Some startups have attempted
                to address this issue by building secondary marketplaces on their platforms. Yet,
                these marketplaces often see limited activity and struggle to attract enough users
                interested in this asset class to boost the velocity of fractional transactions.
                Limited liquidity can indeed be a concern for investors seeking flexibility in their
                investments.

                startups venturing into the world of fractional ownership. But lets not forget,
                every great innovation faces challenges along the way. Overcoming these hurdles will
                pave the path to a brighter future for fractional ownership, revolutionizing the way
                we invest in real estate. It’s a thrilling journey filled with potential,
                innovation, and the promise of transforming the world of investment as we know it.

                Here’s where things get really exciting —{' '}
                <b>Fractional ownership and Co-ownership.</b> This feature, seamlessly integrated
                into the applications created by property development companies, unleashes a world
                of possibilities. Fractional ownership makes life easier for property developers
                compared to struggling startups. It strategically opens doors to an untapped yet
                addressable market. Imagine giving individuals with limited purchasing power a seat
                at the table, all without breaking a sweat. And how does Veerge make it possible?
                Through its robust infrastructure that does the heavy lifting.

                Fractional ownership doesn’t change the traditional way of selling properties; it
                introduces a whole new approach. Ownership of some residential units are divided
                into smaller, more affordable portions, with fractional prices that can be as low as
                the property development company desires. Even the company’s staff can invest, along
                with their family members. In Africa, there are property development companies with
                thousands of registered realtors. These realtors become champions, convincing people
                to invest in fractional ownership, all while earning their commission. And when the
                realtors receive their commissions, they can also invest in it themselves. It’s a
                win-win for everyone involved. Those potential buyers whose dream investment
                properties are just slightly out of reach can now also seize the opportunity. And
                when it comes to major decisions, a voting poll can be created, giving everyone a
                voice. No more feeling left out or unheard, talk about transparency and inclusivity.
                It’s a revolution in the making, and Veerge is at the forefront, spearheading the
                movement.

                increases, ensuring no money is left on the table. Competitors will struggle to
                service customers who could be yours. Loyalty soars - as 90% of fractional buyers
                are likely first-time real estate investors. As long as promises are fulfilled,
                these customers will become ambassadors, spreading the word about the value creation
                exercise. It’s a ripple effect that sets the stage for exponential growth. You’re
                not just working for short-term gains; you’re building a foundation for results that
                will shine five years down the road. As the purchasing power of your fractional
                buyers increases, they’ll keep coming back to the property development company’s
                super application, bypassing intermediaries and strengthening the bond between the
                company and their dreams of real estate ownership

                Amazon, the unstoppable force of online retail, owes a large part of its success to
                Amazon Prime. With a staggering army of over 200 million subscribers ready to
                explore whatever Amazon ships with Prime, it’s no wonder they’ve become an
                unbeatable force. But here’s the thing — it didn’t happen overnight. Building such
                an army took time and dedication. However, for property development companies with a
                solid track record and a great reputation, the path to success in fractional
                ownership can be a smooth sail.

                Imagine the power of credibility. Property developers with successful projects under
                their belts can instill confidence in potential investors. Those previous triumphs
                serve as proof of their ability to deliver results and manage properties
                effectively. This credibility becomes a magnet, attracting investors and
                facilitating the growth of fractional ownership initiatives. It’s like having an ace
                up their sleeves, giving them an edge in the race.

                Let’s also not forget the established networks and vast resources. Financial
                resources, marketing resources, human resources — the arsenal is unmatched. They can
                play the long game and conquer the world of fractional ownership. Users have the
                privilege of buying directly from these powerhouses, bypassing intermediaries and
                fees. It’s a direct line to success.

                And here’s another advantage that property developers bring to the table — a
                pipeline of real estate projects. This pipeline gives users access to a wide range
                of properties and can cherry-pick the properties that are most attractive to them,
                perfectly aligning with their objectives. Having a steady supply of properties puts
                property developers in the driver’s seat when it comes to setting up and scaling a
                fractional ownership business. It’s like having a treasure trove of opportunities,
                ready to be unlocked.

                But that’s not all — Veerge has an additional powerful solution called iBuyer,
                currently in its alpha phase. Once launched, property development companies can
                automate the buyback process. Let’s imagine this: if a fraction’s market value is
                $10, you can receive an immediate offer of $9.5 from the development company on the
                secondary market. This feature is a true game-changer, eliminating liquidity issues
                that have plagued the industry in the past. Moreover, property development companies
                can effortlessly attract a vast spectrum of users, making the liquidation of
                fractional assets easier than ever before. With their expertise, know-how, and
                marketing prowess, they can appeal to potential buyers who are interested in living
                in the estate and are willing to buy out fractional owners if desired. This
                harmonious convergence of supply and demand accelerates the velocity of transactions
                on the app. Compliance is also less of a headache compared to the challenges faced
                by startups. It’s like a golden ticket, unlocking a world of possibilities.

                But beyond the economic advantages, property development companies can use
                fractional ownership as a way to showcase their unique identity. It’s a chance to
                demonstrate a company with a conscience and a soul — a company that goes beyond mere
                success and shares it with others in unprecedented ways. It’s about responsibility,
                leveling the playing field, and understanding that when success is shared, all ships
                rise. In this moment of uncertainty and dislocation, people yearn for reassurance,
                guidance, and someone who can help them reach the next level. Wealth will be
                shifting from the hands of the already wealthy to a place where it can be shared by
                all. It’s a revolution that transforms the company into a performance-driven entity,
                through the lens of humanity. So, property development companies, are you ready to
                take the plunge? We’re eagerly waiting to have you on board. Get ready to embark on
                a journey where success is shared, dreams are realized, and the real estate world is
                forever transformed. It’s time to become a driving force in the world of fractional
                ownership, and Veerge is here to make it happen. Let’s pave the way for a future
                where everyone can share in the prosperity.
