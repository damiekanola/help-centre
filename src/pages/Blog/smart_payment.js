              Imagine the joy of owning your dream home — a place to call your own, where you can
              build cherished memories with your family. In the western part of Africa, however,
              this dream seems like an elusive mirage for many hardworking Africans. The housing
              deficit looms large, presenting a daunting challenge that stands between them and
              their dream of homeownership. While buying or building a home are potential options,
              only a select few have the financial means to do so due to the substantial capital
              typically required. For the majority, a mortgage could be the key to unlocking the
              doors of their dream home. But alas! Several factors conspire to keep this door
              tightly shut, making access to mortgages a Herculean task.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              One of the primary impediments to accessing mortgages in Africa is the issue of high
              interest rates, exacerbated by the prevalence of informal economies. Unlike the
              Western world, where mortgage interest rates usually remain in single digits, in
              Africa, rates can soar much higher. For instance, in countries like Nigeria, people
              may fix deposits with mortgage banks for as high as 13%. This is often linked to
              inflation, as higher inflation rates erode the purchasing power of the currency,
              leading to the need for higher interest rates to compensate for the loss, making it
              impossible for any mortgage bank to offer home loans at single-digit rates. The high
              cost of funds, coupled with the inherent nature of banking operations that involve
              margins and intermediation, create further challenges.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Consequently, mortgages become unattainable for many, particularly those in the
              informal sector, which constitutes a significant portion of the population. The lack
              of easily verifiable and stable income in the informal sector makes it challenging for
              individuals to meet the stringent income requirements set by traditional mortgage
              lenders, further limiting access to mortgage financing. As a result, hardworking
              Africans, who aspire to own a home and create a stable future for their families, are
              left with limited options and find themselves excluded from the formal housing market.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Another contributing factor is the low income levels prevalent in many African
              countries. The relatively meager average income further compounds the financial strain
              of homeownership, making it unaffordable for numerous individuals and families.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Moreover, the inadequate formalization of property rights in many African countries
              poses a significant challenge for lenders. The absence of clear ownership and legal
              protection in case of default creates uncertainty for financial institutions,
              discouraging them from providing mortgage loans. Limited access to credit is another
              obstacle to mortgage acquisition. Financial institutions in some African countries
              have stringent lending criteria, making it difficult for potential borrowers to
              qualify for a mortgage, further limiting access to homeownership.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Venturing deeper into this maze, we encounter the underdeveloped financial markets — a
              labyrinth of limited long-term funding options for mortgage lenders. The scarcity of
              resources leads to a scarcity of mortgages, further dimming the prospects for aspiring
              homeowners.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Political and economic instability in certain regions of Africa further compounds the
              issue. Uncertainty and risk deter potential investors and lenders from engaging in the
              housing market, which has a ripple effect on borrowers’ ability to access mortgages.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure, such as the absence of proper land
              registration systems, hinders the growth of mortgage markets and property development,
              creating barriers to homeownership
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Lastly, demographic challenges, such as rapid urbanization and population growth in
              some African countries, place immense pressure on housing demand and supply. This
              imbalance makes it difficult for mortgage markets to keep up with the pace, leaving
              many individuals without access to affordable mortgage options.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              As the sun sets on this gripping tale of homeownership challenges in Africa, we are
              reminded that overcoming these obstacles requires a collective effort. Thankfully,
              some real estate companies have stepped up to simplify the process of property
              acquisition. Gone are the days when property builders demanded outright payments. Now,
              property development companies offer flexible payment plans, providing a glimmer of
              hope for aspiring homeowners.

              Let’s delve into a real life case study featuring Mary in 2023, a determined
              individual searching for her dream home in Lagos. After tirelessly exploring various
              avenues, she discovers a two-bedroom apartment that matches her criteria and price
              range. The property is priced at <b>₦28,609,500</b> for an outright payment. However,
              with the availability of the property development company’s flexible payment plans,
              Mary has options that suit her financial situation. Considering a 12-month payment
              plan, Mary will make an initial deposit of <b>₦8,529,900</b>. Over the course of 12
              months, she will have to pay <b>₦6,809,000</b> quarterly, gradually reducing her
              outstanding balance. With this payment plan, Mary will ultimately pay an extra
              ₦27,236,000 over the 12-month period, including the initial deposit. Calculating the
              interest rate, this amounts to approximately 36% using the formula((
              <b>₦7,236,000/₦20,000,000)*100</b>).
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Now, let’s consider an alternative scenario: If someone were to take a year-long
              mortgage of <b>20 million Naira</b> at an interest rate of <b>54.43%</b>, paid
              quarterly, you might expect a daunting total payment. Surprisingly, the amount would
              be approximately <b>27,235,769.83</b> Naira, which is slightly less than Mary’s
              payment on her chosen payment plan
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              Mary’s journey to homeownership became a seamless and convenient experience, all
              thanks to the innovative Veerge portal provided by the property development company.
              With the aid of Veerge, the property developmennt company developed an app with just
              clicks without a single line of code that revolutionized the end-to-end process of
              home ownership, simplifying every step for Mary.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="30px">
              One of the app’s standout features is “<b>Auto-pay</b>,” which proved to be a
              game-changer for buyers opting for payment plans like Mary. Upon her purchase, the app
              offered her the option to automate her payment plan by linking her card or bank
              account. This remarkable convenience feature ensured that when the payment was due, it
              was automatically processed, lifting the burden of manual transactions from her
              shoulders. With a smile, Mary happily chose to automate her quarterly payment of{' '}
              <b>₦6,809,000</b>, and she even had the flexibility to switch to monthly, weekly, or
              daily payments if she found it more convenient. This level of control and ease of
              payment management transformed the way property development companies handled
              transactions, making it a win-win for both buyers and sellers.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Embracing this quantum leap in automation, development companies can streamline their
              payment processes, making every transaction a seamless affair. The use of the Veerge
              app allowed all payments to be effortlessly logged on their management systems, while
              buyers like Mary could conveniently track their payments and outstanding balances
              through the user-friendly application.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              In my experience, I have encountered three types of individuals opting for payment
              plans. There are those who might not have the means for their outstanding balance but
              are hopeful and determined to find a way to manage it. Then, there are those who have
              the means and demonstrate diligence by staying on top of their outstanding balances.
              Lastly, some buyers have the means but prefer owing the development company, keeping
              their funds available for other ventures.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Among the segment of people who have the means and are diligent with their outstanding
              balances, a significant number prefers having their funds accessible in their bank
              accounts and diligently sticking to making payments precisely on the due dates.
              However, there are also individuals who are averse to debt and find great comfort in
              making payments at the earliest opportunity. These individuals, in particular, become
              the biggest fans of the “Auto-pay” feature. It alleviates any worries about missing
              payment deadlines, grants them the flexibility of customizing their payments, and
              ultimately provides them with much-needed peace of mind.

            <Text mt="30px">
              At Veerge, we believe in continuous improvement and collaboration with property
              development companies to better serve their customers. Through our program, with the
              permission of the property development company, we work closely with their support
              team for two weeks every three months. This collaboration allows us to gather valuable
              insights and receive reports, helping us build features that their customers truly
              desire.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              When we launched the Autopay feature, we faced a challenge initially as the adoption
              rate for this feature was slow. We realized that this was because there was no clear
              incentive or reward for using Auto-pay. In the case of a buyer like Mary, although she
              received a notification about the convenience of customizing her payments daily,
              weekly, or monthly, she found it equally easy to use a micro saving app instead. By
              doing so, she could make daily payments and earn interest on her capital over the
              course of three months. Subsequently, she could then transfer the capital to her due
              payment plan.
            </Text>

            <Text mt="30px">
              Acknowledging this shortfall, we were fortunate to have an alpha-phase feature that
              could address this issue. This innovative feature became our secret weapon in
              accelerating the cash flow into the company. We understand that time can be both a
              buyer’s best friend and worst enemy when it comes to payments. When buyers choose to
              pay early, time works in their favor, providing a sense of accomplishment and
              potentially reducing their outstanding balances. With this powerful feature in place,
              buyers like Mary can seize full advantage of prepayment incentives. Each prepayment
              she makes not only reduces her debt burden but also comes with the rewarding benefit
              of avoiding additional interest charges. This personalized approach to payment plans
              serves as a powerful incentive, motivating buyers to make timely payments and take
              control of their financial journey. As a result, the velocity of cash flow into the
              property development company is further enhanced, fueling growth and enabling more
              aspiring homeowners to realize their dreams. With every prepayment, Mary not only
              moves closer to owning her dream home but also gains the satisfaction of knowing she’s
              making smart financial decisions that benefit her in the long run. The interplay of
              buyer incentives and accelerated cash flow reshapes the landscape of real estate
              transactions, making homeownership a more attainable and rewarding reality for all.

              The question then arises: How did we design this revolutionary payment model? It’s an
              entirely different option for property development companies, steering away from the
              traditional payment structure of Initial deposit (X amount), Installment payment (Y
              amount), payment frequency (Z), resulting in the purchase price of the property as
              X+Y(Z). Instead, Veerge offers an improved approach that simplifies the process for
              both buyers and developers. Instead of relying on the typical payment plan structure —
              comprising an initial deposit (X amount), installment payments (Y amount), payment
              frequency (Z), and calculating the purchase price as X + Y(Z) — we sought to enhance
              the model.

              Now, all a development company needs to provide is the initial deposit, the yearly
              interest rate, and the desired longest payment duration that suits their preferences.
              Veerge takes it from there, automatically performing complex calculations. By calling
              the outright price value and breaking down the yearly interest rate into an effective
              daily rate, we lay the foundation for a more personalized and buyer-friendly payment
              plan. Let’s put things into perspective-For a property selling at $100,000.00
              outright, let’s assume the development company chooses an initial deposit of 20%
              ($20,000.00) and a 36-month payment plan with a 20% per annum interest rate. Veerge
              transforms this into an effective daily interest rate (0.05065577%) to ensure accuracy
              in the calculations (please note that we use 360 days)

              So, for someone to purchase this property, they would begin by paying the initial
              deposit, which amounts to $20,000.00. Once this deposit is made, the outstanding
              balance of $80,000 (outright price — initial deposit) remains.

              At this point, the buyer has the flexibility to customize how they want to make
              payments for the $80,000, which compounds daily. Veerge’s offers a range of payment
              options for the buyer’s convenience. They can choose to make daily, weekly, monthly,
              or even yearly payments, tailoring the payment plan to their unique financial
              situation. The beauty of this approach lies in the incentives provided for every
              prepayment made.

              The underlying idea is straightforward yet powerful — for every day that the
              subscriber doesn’t carry a debt, it positively impacts their debt burden. By allowing
              buyers to customize their payment schedules and providing incentives for prepayments,
              Veerge individualizes the payment plan for each home buyer. This personalized approach
              not only empowers buyers to take control of their financial journey but also motivates
              them to make timely payments and achieve their dream of homeownership sooner.

            <Text mt="30px">
              The prepayment incentive not only benefits property subscribers but also has a
              profound impact on the property development company. It works as a catalyst,
              accelerating the velocity of cash flow into the company. By incentivizing buyers to
              make early payments, Veerge creates a positive cycle of financial growth that benefits
              both buyers and property developers alike. The platform empowers homebuyers to take
              control of their payment journey, making the path to homeownership more rewarding and
              accessible.
